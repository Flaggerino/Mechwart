	<h2>For everyone, everywhere!</h2>
<p>There are <em>different</em> predetermined <strong>EQ curves</strong> <i>(called Moods)</i> with the <em>ability</em> <u>to add</u> <b>custom EQ</b> tuning with a <u>10-band equalizer</u>. <b>G HUB</b> is where you can turn on <i>DTS Headphone: X 2.0 surround sound</i>. <q>I prefer G HUB to the old Logitech Gaming Software. I find it easy to navigate and use.</q> Admittedly there aren’t many variables for the <b>G432</b> since it <b>doesn’t</b> have lighting, but what is there is <u>clear and self-explanatory</u>.</p>

<p>The sound of the G432 is very good when connected through the <b>USB dongle</b>. The <u>midrange</u> is clear, and the high-end has some nice sparkle although it’s a bit understated. <u>Bass response</u> is more subdued than has been the trend since Beats came out, and it’s a refreshing change. There’s nice clarity and it doesn’t overpower the midrange.That great sound is evident in games with large dynamic ranges like <ol><li>Battlefront II</li>  
<li>Destiny 2</li></ol>. The action envelops you with <b>explosions</b> having depth without obscuring <b>weapon fire</b> coming from <i>different</i> directions. The <u>DTS</u> surround placed effects accurately and <i>helped me</i> know where <strong>an enemy was attacking from</strong>. It’s 
<b>a significant advantage</b> over playing with a <u>stereo mix.</u></p>
