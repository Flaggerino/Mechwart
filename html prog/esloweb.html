<b>Logitech</b> has released an update to its <u>headset line</u>, and included in the new lineup is the updated G432 <i><a href="amazon.co.uk">(See it on Amazon)</a></i>. It’s a replacement for the stalwart G430 that had been around for years, so it was high time for an update. While the looks have only seen minor changes, the significant enhancements have been where it counts: the drivers and the microphone. </p>

<p>
The look of the <b>G432</b> is heavily inspired by its <i>predecessor</i>. They’re all black with a pop of the same <u>Logitech blue</u> color found on the <b>G430</b>, although now only as a ring around and on the interior of the ear pads. The Logitech G gaming emblem is on both earcups. Apart from the limited blue and silver accents, the G432 are understated for a gaming headset.Internally the drivers have been upgraded from <ul><li>40mm</li> <li> 50mm</li></ul>. Larger drivers allow the headset to potentially produce more accurate sound compared to if it had smaller drivers, like the 40mm units found in its predecessor, the G430. The microphone is larger, too, and housed within a retractable boom that mutes in the up position.The G432 are a wired-only headset, so they're compatible with PC, Mac, Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and mobile devices with 3.5mm connections. The cable is 6.5 feet long, so it offers plenty of slack if you don’t have front connections on your PC or are connecting directly to your console that sits by the TV.
